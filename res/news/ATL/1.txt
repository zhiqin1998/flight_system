You don’t ever want to hear that the weather “could pack a punch,” but that’s how Channel 2 Action News chief meteorologist Glenn Burns described the storm potential for Saturday afternoon.
Metro Atlanta and North Georgia are expected to see patches of severe weather between noon and 3 p.m., so it’s recommended to squeeze your time outdoors into the morning hours.

“If you have stuff to do, the morning is the time to do that,” Burns said. “It’ll be a partly cloudy sky (in the morning) and a great start to our Saturday.”Unfortunately, that great start is expected to fizzle out around lunchtime as a wave of storms enters the state from Alabama. By “pack a punch,” Burns means that 60 mph winds, large hail and lightning strikes are possible this afternoon.The weather should clear up after 3 p.m., with only a few lingering showers to dampen the evening.

But a second wave of storms is expected to move in overnight and into Sunday morning, Channel 2 meteorologist Eboni Deon said. “Later tonight, the rain and storms move back in and we are going to be dealing with wet conditions on and off again through the first half of the day on Sunday,” Deon said. If it wasn’t for the rain, the Shaky Knees Music Festival would have an impeccable forecast, but attendees may want to bring a poncho and prepare for some on-and-off showers during the later acts at Atlanta’s Central Park.RELATED: Shaky Knees 2019: lineup, tickets, transportation and more information
