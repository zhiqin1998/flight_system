KUALA LUMPUR: Speakers at the 405 Rally that took place here on Saturday (May 4) voiced their dissatisfaction on several matters such as the death of fireman Muhammad Adib Mohd Kassim and an alleged threat to the institution of Malay rulers.

Umno Youth chief Datuk Dr Asyraf Wajdi Dusuki said justice had not been delivered over the death of fireman Muhammad Adib during the Seafield temple riots.

"Today (May 4) is World Firefighters' Day, and we are remembering him," he said the crowd which gathered outside the Sogo shopping complex here on Saturday (May 4).

He questioned why those responsible for Adib's death had not been identified yet why action had not been taken against them.

The rally, he said was to defend the Federal Constitution and the institution of the monarchy, which protects the role of Islam in the country.

"We also call for (Attorney General) Tommy Thomas to resign for letting the institution of the monarchy be insulted," he added.

PAS deputy president Datuk Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man also urged rally-goers to continue the fight against threats to Islam in the country.

He said the gathering served as a "warning and a reminder" not to sideline Muslims and Malays.

"Our gathering, in conjunction with the start of the Ramadan fasting month, is meant to unite Muslims and establish harmony in the country," he said.

He urged "certain parties" not to underestimate the strength of the Muslims nor take advantage of them.

The rally started at 2pm, with participants marching from Masjid Jamek to the Sogo shopping complex and finished at 3.30pm.

The rally was organised by the Gerakan Pembela Ummah and several other NGOs.

Organisers said that the event was to protest against the Pakatan Harapan government for allegedly sidelining Malays and Muslims on issues pertaining to the Rome Statute, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Icerd) and the Unified Examination Certificate, among other matters.
