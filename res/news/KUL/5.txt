KUALA Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) is paying RM3 for every rat caught at the Jinjang Utara morning market until May 10, in an effort to control the population of the pest.

Kepong MP Lim Lip Eng said the DBKL booth set up at the market from 9am to 11am would only accept live rats, but he would write in to request for dead rats to be accepted.

"We would propose to DBKL to accept dead rats too. Otherwise, we are afraid that the programme will not be successful. If we have to catch the rats alive, our option to catch them is limited to using the traps," he said.

It was learnt that the market traders have requested for such a programme to control the population of rats in the area.

There are over 360 stalls in the market that has been operating for more than three decades.

Hawker Wong Keen Po said the increase in rat population could be due to clogged drains.

"I have seen rats that are as big as cats, and they are more active at dusk," he said.

A DBKL source said similar programmes were also conducted at Pudu, Cheras and Keramat markets recently.

"In the past, we offered RM2 per rat but we provided the traps. However, not all cages were returned. So now, we are offering RM3 per rat, and it is up to the people how they want to catch it.

"The idea is to involve the community in DBKL's effort to control the rat population," he said.
