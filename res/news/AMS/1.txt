The student campuses in Amsterdam are not safe, student union ASVA warns. The union received 39 reports of incidents over the last two months alone, mainly involving incidents of violence, sexual offenses, robbery and burglary, AD reports.

A large part of these reports came from the Spinoza Campus and the nearby apartment buildings Echtenstein and Bergwijkdreef in Amsterdam Zuidoost. Students also feel unsafe at the campus on the NDSM wharf, according to ASVA.

"It is unacceptable that students experience such unsafe situations at the place where they live", ASVA chairman Alba van Vliet said to the newspaper. "The municipality, housing corporations and police now really need to come up with structural solutions."
