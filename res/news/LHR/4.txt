A huge plume of smoke could be seen for miles as firefighters tackled a huge blaze near Heathrow Airport.

Thick, black smoke could be seen billowing into the west London sky on Sunday afternoon, while witnesses claimed to hear a number of explosions.

Trains through West Drayton were reportedly delayed as firefighters tackled the blaze. People living in the area were told to keep their doors and windows closed.

The London Fire Brigade said 10 fire engines and around 70 firefighters were called to an old coal depot in Tavistock Road.

A container, an industrial conveyor belt, 15 vans and three articulated lorries were alight, a spokeswoman said.

Station Manager Jon Holt, who was at the scene, said: "The fire is very visible and is producing a lot of smoke. Residents and businesses in the area should keep their windows and doors shut and drivers should avoid the area if possible."

The LFB said 999 control officers took 55 calls to the blaze. Around 15 people left the yard before the Brigade arrived and there were no reports of any injuries.

The Brigade was called 2.16pm. The cause of the fire is not yet known.
