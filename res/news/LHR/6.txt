A man has been arrested after a broad daylight knife attack next to a west London university campus.

Police were called to Kingston Lane in Uxbridge, near the site of Brunel University London, just before 8.30am on Saturday.

The suspect, aged in his 30s, attempted to escape on a bus.

However, he was detained and arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent, possession of an offensive weapon and affray.

The victim, aged 28, left the scene in a vehicle before police arrived.
