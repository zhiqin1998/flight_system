A large fire has ripped through a spa and hotel in south-west London.

About 100 firefighters and 15 engines were at the scene battling the blaze in Richmond on Tuesday evening.

Dramatic footage showed smoke billowing into the sky as flames tore through the building in Richmond Hill.

The whole of the roof of the spa building is alight and part of the third floor of the adjoining hotel is also on fire, London Fire Brigade (LFB) confirmed.

"The fire is in an annexe building and has been producing a lot of smoke.

â€œWe would urge residents and businesses in the immediate area to keep windows and doors closed while we continue to tackle the fire."
