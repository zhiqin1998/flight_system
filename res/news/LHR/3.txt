A seagull that keeps landing on top of a traffic camera in London has become an internet hit.

The bird has sparked a flurry of hilarious responses after it was pictured in various poses in front of the traffic camera on Brunswick Road

A video posted on the Transport for London Traffic News account today showed the seagull's head bobbing around and was accompanied by the caption: “Due to popular demand, a quick update from our popular reporter just north of the Blackwall Tunnel.”

Twitter users responded to the post with jokes with one commenter saying: “Always good to get a bird's eye view.”

Another drew attention to the traffic veering left saying: “Is he advising people not to take any left turns?”

Twitter user, Paul Smith also wrote: “Future Mayor of London I think.”

Yesterday, TfL Traffic News also posted a screenshot with the caption: “Guess who’s back?!”

Before that, the account had posted a picture of the seagull with the caption: "Happy Monday."

The posts have racked up thousands of likes and retweets.
